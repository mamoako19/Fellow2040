API challenge 

You can complete the API challenge using the language and platform you’re most comfortable with. While you could probably work out a way to make the API happy using manual input, we’re also going to ask you to share the code you use—and we’ll be sharing that code with potential employers, as well. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to show you can solve problems as a programmer.
